# NavigationControllerSample
A sample to illustrate a question about UINavigationController

## Objective
I want to initialize a `UINavigationController`, but with my standard set of view controllers. For this reason, I'd like to give users of my class `CustomViewController` just a simple `init()`. But when I call `super.init(rootController:)` in the initializer, the app crashes.

* Am I doing it wrong?

* What would be the best way to achieve this?
